                                ...I still remember that day when I first met with you in class 9. Then we became friends. Sadly in class 10, we got apart. There was no contact between us. I never thought I would meet you again. But suddenly we met again at class 11 Debu Da's batch. I got my friend back. That was the best time of my life. We had a memorable time, at least for me it is memorable. I can never forget that time. I called you lesbian, pulled your hair and you got very angry after that. I felt that very cute. Slowly I got attached to you. I remember every moment I spent with you.

                                But on the last of 11 again I left all of my tuition and I lost contact with you again and it was my biggest fault. When I got in touch with you again you got completely changed. You even did not like my behavior then. When I tried to pull your hair and do the same things again I used to do with you, you got angry and this time it was serious. I couldn't recognize you then. I was thinking then are you the same Eshita I used to know once? Once you called me and asked if I was coming to attend the classes but nowadays you even don't think of me.

                                Maybe it was all my fault. I did some bad things and I am genuinely sorry for those. I still think about those incidents and regret it. If you can please forgive me.

                                It was never a Love at first sight or anything. I still even don't know WHY, WHEN, or HOW I fall for you. But the matter of fact is I fell and it was out of my control. But the thing is I can't undo it now. And I know maybe you will not accept me but My love for you will remain unchanged.

                                The Only Thing I know now is that I LOVE YOU. I love your all silly stuff and all the funny faces you make. I find it kinda cute. You are the only girl I fear after my mother. I love to spend time with you. I love to walk with you. I love it when you get angry with me. I love it when I give you something and you say 'thankuiii', I can do anything for that. Every little thing from you makes me happy. I want to be that guy who you remember at you have any problem or while you are sad. I DON'T KNOW WHY I love you this much and seriously I don't wanna even find the answer. I LOVE YOU and That's all.
